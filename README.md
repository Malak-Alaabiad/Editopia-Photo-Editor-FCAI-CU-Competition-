Editopia (Photo Editor Application) 

My name is: Malak Mohamed Saad Fahmy Al-Aabiad 

From Faculty of Computers and Artificial Intelligence- Cairo University. 
A first level student. 

All this is under the supervision of: Dr. Mohamed El-Ramly
In the Structured programming Course (CS112).

Now I will begin explaining the application:

First we will click on the start button to start the application.

If we click on the end button, the program will close.

When the program starts, the first thing we will do is that we will load the image that we would like to process using the filters in the application, and after that we will click on the filters button to show all the filters. 

Now we will try all the filters:

The Grayscale filter: is a filter that turns the image into gray. 

The Black and white filter: is a filter that converts an image to black and white. 

The Invert filter: is a filter that inverts the colors of an image. 

The Infrared filter: is a filter that shows the image under infrared rays. 

The PurpleScale filter: that turns the image into purple. 

The Natural sunlight filter: is a filter that makes the image look like it is under sunlight. 

The Old TV filter: is a filter that makes the image appear as if it appears on an old television screen. 

The Brightness filter: is a filter that lightens and darkens the colors of an image using this slider which called brightness slider. 

The Oil Painting filter: is a filter that makes the image appear as if it was painted in oil colors. 

The Blur filter: is a filter that blurs the image as shown, and the blur ratio increases as we increase the blur ratio slider. 

The Detect Edge filter: is a filter that identifies the edges of an image. 

The Crop filter: is a filter that crops any part of the image from any position you want. 

The Merge filter: is a filter that merges two images with each other, either by increasing the dimensions of the smaller image to equal the dimensions of the larger image, or by cropping the larger image so that its farthest dimensions match the dimensions of the small image.

The Image Skewing filter: makes the image skew at any specified angle, in either the left or right direction. 

The Flip filter: is a filter that flips the image vertically or horizontally.

The Rotate filter: rotates the image up to 360 degrees. 


The Resizing filter: is a filter that changes the dimensions of an image. 

The Adding Frame filter: adds a frame to the image, and you can control the color of the frame as you want. You can add two frames in the same image in two different colors or the same color.

The Mirror filter: is a filter that makes the image appear to be reflected in a mirror. 

The PopArt colors filter: is a filter that merges the image with itself 4 times, turning it into a different color each Time.

Finally, if we want to save the image that we have modified, we click on the Save Image button and choose the location where we would like to save the image.
